I humor these thoughts because these exercises keep my mind active. It's almost futile to predict the future of interactions in light of so many technological enhancements. I can only hope not to embarrass myself. 

I sometimes get a bad rap for this kind of thinking. I'm a product manager and this is not product thinking.
